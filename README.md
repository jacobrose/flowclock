# FlowClock

A smoothly animated clock for horizontal viewing on a docked iPhone.

## Design Intent

Avoid pulsing lights or jumping images, while allowing the time
to be easily read.

Ultimately, I'd like this to be my default view in Standby mode, with
complications for date, day of week, first event of the new day, etc.
